                Hunt you down, eat you alive</br>
                Just like animals, animals, like animals</br>
                Maybe you think you that can hide</br>
                I can smell your scent for miles</br>
                Just like animals, animals, like animals</br>

                You can find other fish in the sea</br>
                You can pretend it’s meant to be</br>
                But you can’t stay away from me</br>
                I can still hear you making that sound</br>
                Taking me down, oh, under the ground</br>
                You can pretend it was me below </br>
                Baby I’m preying on you tonight</br>
