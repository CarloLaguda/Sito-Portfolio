                Barely stuttered out a joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue</br>
                Weighed down with words too overdramatic</br>
                Tonight it's "It can't get much worse"</br>
                Vs. "No one should ever feel like"</br>
                I'm two quarters and a heart down</br>
                And I don't wanna forget how your voice sounds</br>
                These words are all I have so I'll write them</br>
                So you need them just to get by</br>
                Dance, dance</br>
                We're falling apart to half time</br>
                Dance, dance</br>
                And these are the lives you love to lead</br>
                Dance, this is the way they'd love</br>
                If they knew how misery loved me</br>
                You always fold just before you're found out</br>
                Drink up it's last call</br>
                Last resort, but only the first mistake, and I</br>
                I'm two quarters and a heart down</br>
                And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds</br>
                These words are all I have so I'll write them</br>
                So you need them just to get by</br>
                Why don't you show me a little bit of spine</br>
                You've been saving for his mattress, love</br>
                Dance, dance</br>
                We're falling apart to half time</br>
                Dance, dance</br>
                And these are the lives you love to lead</br>
                Dance, this is the way they'd love</br>
                If they knew how misery loved me</br>
                Why don't you show me a little bit of spine</br>
                You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)</br>
                I only want sympathy in the form of you</br>
                Crawling into bed with me</br>
                Dance, dance</br>
                We're falling apart to half time</br>
                Dance, dance</br>
                And these are the lives you love to lead</br>
                Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love)</br>
