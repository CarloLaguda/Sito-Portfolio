                Ohhh</br>
                Say my name and his in the same breath</br>
                I dare you to say they taste the same</br>
                Let the leaves fall off in the summer</br>
                And let December glow in flames</br>
                Erase myself and let go</br>
                Start it over again in Mexico</br>
                These friends, they don't love you</br>
                They just love the hotel suites, now</br>
                I don't care what you think</br>
                As long as it's about me</br>
                The best of us can find happiness in misery</br>
                I said I don't care what you think</br>
                As long as it's about me</br>
                The best of us can find happiness in misery</br>
                Ohh</br>
                Ohh</br>
                Oh take a chance let your body get a tolerance</br>
                I'm not a chance, put a heat wave in your pants</br>
                Pull a breath like another cigarette</br>
                Pawnshop heart trading up (trading up)</br>
                On the oracle in my chest,</br>
                Let the guitar scream like a fascist</br>
                Sweat it out, shut your mouth</br>
                Free love on the streets but</br>
                In the alley it ain't that cheap, now</br>
                I don't care what you think</br>
                As long as it's about me</br>
                The best of us can find happiness in misery</br>
