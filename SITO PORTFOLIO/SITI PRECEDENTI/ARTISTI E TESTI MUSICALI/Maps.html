                I miss the conversation</br>
                I'm searching for a song tonight</br>
                I'm changing all of the stations</br>
                I like to think that we had it all</br>
                We drew a map to a better place</br>
                But on that road, I took a fall</br>
                Oh baby, why did you run away?</br>
                I was there for you in your darkest times</br>
                I was there for you in your darkest night</br>
                But I wonder, where were you?</br>
                When I was at my worst down on my knees</br>
                And you said you had my back</br>
                So I wonder, where were you?</br>
                When all the roads you took came back to me</br>
                So I'm following the map that leads to you</br>
                The map that leads to you</br>
                Ain't nothing I can do</br>
                The map that leads to you</br>
                Following, following, following to you</br>
                The map that leads to you</br>
                Ain't nothing I can do</br>
                The map that leads to you</br>
                Following, following, following</br>
                I hear your voice in my sleep at night</br>
                Hard to resist temptation</br>
                'Cause something strange has come over me</br>
                Now, I can't get over you</br>
                No, I just can't get over you</br>
                I was there for you in your darkest times</br>
                I was there for you in your darkest night</br>
                But I wonder, where were you?</br>
